**Dynamic Filters:** Users can filter data based on Marital Status, Region, and Education Level for tailored insights.<br />
**Income Analysis:** Displays average income per purchase categorized by gender and purchase decision.<br />
**Age Demographics:** Highlights customer purchasing behavior across different age brackets (Adolescent, Middle Age, Old).<br />
**Commute Analysis:** Examines how commute distance affects bike purchases through a comparative line chart.<br />
**Professional Design:** Structured layout with clear visualizations, making data interpretation intuitive.<br />

**Tools Used:**<br />
Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Conditional Formatting)<br />

This project demonstrates my ability to design data-driven dashboards with effective visual storytelling, improving decision-making for business insights.
